# The meta-concepts of data analysis, reproducible workflows and projects in R.  

This is a place to collaborate on resources and potential meetups to discuss the 
meta-concepts of data analysis.  

The format will likely evolve, but if you would like to contribute, feel free
to PR any resources or ideas, or just submit an issue for discussion.
